# Chipojo

Chipojo is a communication tool between people who know what they need and the people that will build it. It let's people that have an idea of what they want document requirements, specifications, explanations, and examples. The people that build the system can then turn those requirements, specifications, explanations, and examples into executable code that can verify the system being constructed. Doing this [bridges the communication gap] between all the people that need to build the system.
